                  1. Why and how is this image interesting? <i>Provide a detailed read and explanation.</i>
               </h5>
               
               <p>
                  I spent the all of Spring Quarter 2020 at home with my family, trying to adjust to online school and the rest of pandemic life. I really missed Davis though, so in mid-June I decided that I wanted to go back. My first step of packing was to set out my suitcase. But I had to pause my packing because my cat Sally decided to lay inside my suitcase. I guess she wanted me to stay!
               </p>

               <h5>
                  2. How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection?
               </h5>

               <p>
                  The topic of my archive is pictures of my two cats Tiger and Sally.
               </p>

                  3. How does your collection or archive say something (i.e. tell a story) about you?
               </h5>

               <p>
                  My archive is focused much more on my cats than it is on me. But I guess it shows how much I love and care about them.

               <h4>Part Two</h4>
               <figure>
                  <img src="images/DavidPicture.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Minecraft with ray tracing">

               <h5>
                  1. What is this image about? 
               </h5>

               <p>
                  David Hoang is my partner for this assignment. The image he gave me is a screenshot from the video game <i>Minecraft</i>. His character is standing next to a body of water and looking at a forest on the other side. David installed a certain type of mod, called a "shader mod", that makes his game look much more realistic and pleasing to the eye than it would otherwise.
               </p>

               <h5>
                  2. What are the most interesting aspects of this image? Describe using some of the language in the introduction to this assignment.
               </h5>

               <p>
                  To me, it seems like the purpose of this image is to showcase the shader mod that David installed. The environmental lighting and the surface of the water look much more beautiful than they would without the mod installed. The way that the water reflects the environment around it is only possible with this sort of mod installed. This location was probably chosen to show off the water reflections specifically.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The fact that there are no other players in this image may indicate that David is playing in singleplayer. Singleplayer <i>Minecraft</i> often evokes the feeling of trying to survive on your own.
               </p>

               <h5>
                  3. What are the most obvious and the most mysterious aspects of this image?
               </h5>

               <p>
                  The most obvious part of the image is that it looks like a very blocky world and that there is water, grass, and a forest. Those familiar with <i>Minecraft</i> would easily be able to recognize that this is a screenshot from the game, and many of them would instantly notice that there is a shader mod installed.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The most mysterious part of the image to me is the fact that it is extremely compressed and low resolution. While I understand that we need to optimize for the web, this may have gone too far to the point that there is a very noticeable quality drop. It is more difficult to appreciate the detail put into the lighting and water effects when the image is this compressed. It makes me wonder if there is some outside reason for the low image quality.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Beyond that, another mystery is whether this <i>Minecraft</i> world already existed before David downloaded the mod or if he created this world specifically to test the mod.

               <strong>Visual Thinking Website</strong>:

                  Flipaclip
               </a>
            </p>

            <p>
               Flipaclip is an animation app for iOS and Android that is geared toward both beginners and professionals. But this journal entry is about their website.
            </p>

            <p>
               The Flipaclip home page plays several animations as the user scrolls up or down the page. Many of them emphasize the features of the app, from animation tools to sharing features to in-app contests and learning resources.
            </p>

            <p>
               One such animation shows a frame-by-frame hand-drawn animation of a bouncing ball paired with the caption "Simple. Intuitive. Fun." As the user continues scrolling, the animation later transitions to the ball bouncing within the app's interface, as if a user had drawn it. This animation helps highlight how easy the app is to use and helps the user feel like they can use the app too.
            </p>

            <p>
               Other user-created animations shown on the page, such as the hand-drawn animation near the bottom and the rotoscoping example, are much more complex. These are shown to appeal to more experienced artists.
            </p>

            <p>
               Some of the animations cause the scrolling to seemingly halt the page's vertical momentum. This encourages the user to focus on the content of that animation instead of scrolling past it. However, I do not feel that this is good UX design. When a user scrolls on a page, they usually expect upward or downward movement, but these animations break that flow, which may lead to user confusion. Other companies such as Apple have used similar techniques, and I personally am not a fan.

            <p>
               The section on buttons is applicable to any button in any context, so its inclusion was confusing to me at first. I guess some people just need to be reminded of this.
            </p>

            <p>
               More web designers should listen to Guideline #6 on user initiation. The internet has too many popups.
            </p>

            <p>
               For the upcoming "Studio 1 - Mad Libs 2.0" assignment, one possible place to use a modal would be when a reset button is pressed. The modal would ask the user to confirm whether or not they would like to reset the form. Having a modal like this would prevent the user from losing their progress if they accidentally click the reset button. If I choose to include a reset button in this project, I will definitely implement this idea.

            <p>
               This article highlighted many important considerations for form design that I had never thought of before. I believe that part of the reason that I had never considered these is this: sometimes the best product design is so seamless and straightforward that the user barely needs to think about it. Form design is no exception to this theory.
            </p>

            <p>
               My primary focus when reading this article was how I could apply these principles to <em>Studio 1: Mad Libs 2.0</em>. A few possiblities are listed below.
            </p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>One-Column Layout</strong>:
                  For easier reading and faster form completion. Multiple sections will likely be unnecessary due to the small size of the form.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Label Position</strong>:
                  Labels will be placed above each input field for easier reading and faster form completion.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Placeholder Text</strong>:
                  Likely won't be necessary for this project.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Field Sizes</strong>:
                  May size fields differently depending on context. For example, number fields may be smaller than word fields.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Auto-focus First Input Field</strong>:
                  To clearly indicate the starting point and remove one tap/click.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Tab-readiness</strong>:
                  I personally use the Tab key to move through text fields all the time, so I want to make sure this form works with this method.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Action button</strong>:
                  The action button to end form entry will need to have a descriptive label, such as "Generate Mad Lib". The button may also need to be disabled on click.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Error Messages</strong>:
                  Error messages will display beneath each input field and need to be concise and specific.
               </li>
            </ul>
