               The section on buttons is applicable to any button in any context, so its inclusion was confusing to me at first. I guess some people just need to be reminded of this.

               More web designers should listen to Guideline #6 on user initiation. The internet has too many popups.

               For the upcoming "Studio 1 - Mad Libs 2.0" assignment, one possible place to use a modal would be when a reset button is pressed. The modal would ask the user to confirm whether or not they would like to reset the form. Having a modal like this would prevent the user from losing their progress if they accidentally click the reset button. If I choose to include a reset button in this project, I will definitely implement this idea.

               This article highlighted many important considerations for form design that I had never thought of before. I believe that part of the reason that I had never considered these is this: sometimes the best product design is so seamless and straightforward that the user barely needs to think about it. Form design is no exception to this theory.
            </p>

            <p>
               My primary focus when reading this article was how I could apply these principles to <em>Studio 1: Mad Libs 2.0</em>. A few possiblities are listed below.
            </p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>One-Column Layout</strong>:
                  For easier reading and faster form completion. Multiple sections will likely be unnecessary due to the small size of the form.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Label Position</strong>:
                  Labels will be placed above each input field for easier reading and faster form completion.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Placeholder Text</strong>:
                  Likely won't be necessary for this project.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Field Sizes</strong>:
                  May size fields differently depending on context. For example, number fields may be smaller than word fields.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Auto-focus First Input Field</strong>:
                  To clearly indicate the starting point and remove one tap/click.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Tab-readiness</strong>:
                  I personally use the Tab key to move through text fields all the time, so I want to make sure this form works with this method.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Action button</strong>:
                  The action button to end form entry will need to have a descriptive label, such as "Generate Mad Lib". The button may also need to be disabled on click.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Error Messages</strong>:
                  Error messages will display beneath each input field and need to be concise and specific.
               </li>
            </ul>
