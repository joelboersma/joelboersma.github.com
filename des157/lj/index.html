                  Flipaclip
               </a>
            </p>

            <p>
               Flipaclip is an animation app for iOS and Android that is geared toward both beginners and professionals. But this journal entry is about their website.
            </p>

            <p>
               The Flipaclip home page plays several animations as the user scrolls up or down the page. Many of them emphasize the features of the app, from animation tools to sharing features to in-app contests and learning resources.
            </p>

            <p>
               One such animation shows a frame-by-frame hand-drawn animation of a bouncing ball paired with the caption "Simple. Intuitive. Fun." As the user continues scrolling, the animation later transitions to the ball bouncing within the app's interface, as if a user had drawn it. This animation helps highlight how easy the app is to use and helps the user feel like they can use the app too.
            </p>

            <p>
               Other user-created animations shown on the page, such as the hand-drawn animation near the bottom and the rotoscoping example, are much more complex. These are shown to appeal to more experienced artists.
            </p>

            <p>
               Some of the animations cause the scrolling to seemingly halt the page's vertical momentum. This encourages the user to focus on the content of that animation instead of scrolling past it. However, I do not feel that this is good UX design. When a user scrolls on a page, they usually expect upward or downward movement, but these animations break that flow, which may lead to user confusion. Other companies such as Apple have used similar techniques, and I personally am not a fan.

            <p>
               The section on buttons is applicable to any button in any context, so its inclusion was confusing to me at first. I guess some people just need to be reminded of this.
            </p>

            <p>
               More web designers should listen to Guideline #6 on user initiation. The internet has too many popups.
            </p>

            <p>
               For the upcoming "Studio 1 - Mad Libs 2.0" assignment, one possible place to use a modal would be when a reset button is pressed. The modal would ask the user to confirm whether or not they would like to reset the form. Having a modal like this would prevent the user from losing their progress if they accidentally click the reset button. If I choose to include a reset button in this project, I will definitely implement this idea.

            </p>

            <p>
               This article highlighted many important considerations for form design that I had never thought of before. I believe that part of the reason that I had never considered these is this: sometimes the best product design is so seamless and straightforward that the user barely needs to think about it. Form design is no exception to this theory.
            </p>

            <p>
               My primary focus when reading this article was how I could apply these principles to <em>Studio 1: Mad Libs 2.0</em>. A few possiblities are listed below.
            </p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>One-Column Layout</strong>:
                  For easier reading and faster form completion. Multiple sections will likely be unnecessary due to the small size of the form.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Label Position</strong>:
                  Labels will be placed above each input field for easier reading and faster form completion.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Placeholder Text</strong>:
                  Likely won't be necessary for this project.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Field Sizes</strong>:
                  May size fields differently depending on context. For example, number fields may be smaller than word fields.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Auto-focus First Input Field</strong>:
                  To clearly indicate the starting point and remove one tap/click.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Tab-readiness</strong>:
                  I personally use the Tab key to move through text fields all the time, so I want to make sure this form works with this method.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Action button</strong>:
                  The action button to end form entry will need to have a descriptive label, such as "Generate Mad Lib". The button may also need to be disabled on click.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Error Messages</strong>:
                  Error messages will display beneath each input field and need to be concise and specific.
               </li>
            </ul>
