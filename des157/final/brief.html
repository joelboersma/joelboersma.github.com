            <h2>Project Summary</h2>

            <p>In Studio 3, I modified the Game of Pig to be a card game instead of a dice game. For my final project, I plan to build on top of Studio 3 to turn it into an entirely different card game, Picture Poker.</p>

            <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
            
            <p>
               24/7 Blackjack is an online version of Blackjack, the classic card game.
            </p>

            <p>
               The user interface design is overall well done. The layout makes sense. While it doesn't feel super organized, real games of blackjack barely are. Button options came up only when necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
               Some of the bubbly/rounded look on the buttons and the cards reminds me of the early iPhone days. It's a design language that most companies have moved past.
            </p>

            <p>
               I feel that the buttons are not prominent enough because of their dark-gray coloring. Making them a different color to stand out more would be beneficial.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               The sounds for this website are used to great effect, including the sounds of cards shuffling, jingles for victory and defeat, and even a jingle for when you first open the game.
            </p>

            <p>
               The animations of the cards being dealt are great too.
            </p>

            <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>

            <p>
               The demo for UNO Online lets anyone play the timeless card game UNO against two computer opponents.
            </p>

            <figure>
               <img src="images/unoOnline.jpg">

            </figure>

            <p>
               The game is limited to a statically-sized canvas element, which means that on larger displays the game would seem relatively small. This can be avoided for my project.
            </p>

            <p>
               Sounds are again used all throughout the game. However, I personally find some of the sounds for UNO to be overly dramatic. For example, playing a reverse card effect makes a giant woosh sound. While these grander sounds enhance the overall experience, I feel they distract from the primary gameplay. The sound effects that I use will be much more subtle.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>

            <p>
               My goal for this project is to make a web-based version of Picture Poker, which is a simplified version of five-card draw.
            </p>

            <p>
               Both of the examples above are card games, so it is easy to make comparisons. I will be utilizing sound like them
            </p>

            <p>
               To me it seems like both of the examples above are using a more complex and capable graphics library to display their games. I am only going to use the basic trio of HTML, CSS, and JS.
            </p>

            <p>
               My game will most likely be designed for Player vs. Dealer, similar to 24/7 Blackjack. When each player has their own private hand, having multiple players on one device makes it difficult to hide each of the hands from the other players.
