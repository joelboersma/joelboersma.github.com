               24/7 Blackjack is an online version of Blackjack, the classic card game.

               The user interface design is overall well done. The layout makes sense. While it doesn't feel super organized, real games of blackjack barely are. Button options came up only when necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
               Some of the bubbly/rounded look on the buttons and the cards reminds me of the early iPhone days. It's a design language that most companies have moved past.

               The sounds for this website are used to great effect, including the sounds of cards shuffling, jingles for victory and defeat, and even a jingle for when you first open the game.
            </p>

            <p>
               The animations of the cards being dealt are great too.
