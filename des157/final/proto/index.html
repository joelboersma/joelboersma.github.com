         <h2>Game of PIG</h2>
         <p>The Game of Pig is a two-player game of chance. A random player is chosen to go first.</p>
         <p>Each turn, a player draws as many pairs of cards as they want, and the combined amount for each card pair gets added to their score. This continues until one of the cards they draw is a 1. When this happens, it is the other player's turn. The player can also choose to end their turn if they feel their luck is running out.</p>
         <p>If a player draws two 1's, that's a Double Cross! That player's score gets reset to zero.</p>
         <p>The first player to get 30 points or higher wins! Good luck!</p>
