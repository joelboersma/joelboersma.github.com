      "description": "Ah, the Fourth of July. Full of barbecues, relaxation, and fireworks. Tiger didn't like the fireworks so much, so he hid under my bed. He had mild-mannered body language as always, but his wide, alert eyes revealed how frightened he really was."

      "description": "Sally is a very curious cat and is always finding new nooks and crannies to relax in. When we found her in this spot we were all surprised! Maybe she wants a bath? Or maybe she just liked how cold the porcelain was? Either way, we had a good laugh."

      "description": "After spending all of Spring Quarter 2020 back home, trying to adjust to fully-online learning, I decided to head back to Davis for the summer. So I got out my suitcase to begin packing. I left my room to grab something, but when I came back, Sally was laying in my suitcase! I guess she didn't want me to leave!"

      "description": "My mom really likes to treat Tiger to some tuna, and sometimes chicken or salmon! But now, Tiger likes to sit in this exact spot, waiting, meowing, and begging for food, even when my mom won't give any to him. Yeah, he's pretty spoiled."

      "description": "Sally loves my sister's room. It's is the only room in the house where she really wants to be pet. But she also likes to go in and out of the room for no real reason. She will often want to be let in only to want to be let out again a minute later. It gets annoying for my sister sometimes, because she's the one that's constantly opening the door for her."

      "description": "Tiger loves to nap on the couch. During the winter he will be on that couch almost all day. We joke that he never leaves it. My dad will occasionally nap on the couch too, and it seems like Tiger enjoys the company. What a relaxing life..."
